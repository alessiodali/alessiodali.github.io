**SITE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

Hi there! 

Since January 11, 2024 I am a *Ricercatore a tempo determinato di tipo B* (tenure-track researcher) in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.mate.polimi.it/) of [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/), Italy. I am part of the [research group in Geometry, Algebra and their Applications](https://www.geometry-algebra.polimi.it/).

[Here](/assets/pdf/CVsite.pdf) is my cv.

My research mostly revolves around topics in commutative algebra, combinatorics, discrete geometry. I am particularly happy when these worlds come together in unexpected ways!

Some keywords:
* Koszul algebras
* graded free resolutions of modules and (algebraic) Betti numbers
* initial ideals and Gr√∂bner bases
* monomial and toric ideals
* simplicial complexes and posets
* homology spheres, flag complexes, Charney-Davis' and Gal's conjectures
* combinatorially defined lattice polytopes (e.g., symmetric edge polytopes)
* equivariant Ehrhart and Hilbert series
* matroids
